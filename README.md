# Pokedex

I practiced React components and properties in this exercise.

It is a pokemon application that displays an interface with boxes containing different pokemon information.

I used 3 components: `App`, `Pokecard` and `Pokedex`.

To run the application:

    npm run dev

Displays in:

    http://localhost:3000/
